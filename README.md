# portfolio-2020
The goal of this project is to create a comprehensive portfolio design that encapsulates both academic and creative pursuits. In other words, I'm looking to hand-code a design that bridges 2 different audiences and functions as an example of digital rhetoric.
## Stage 1
In stage one, I'm most concerned with creating an outline and the basic site contents. The code has been extensively commented so that it can be easily parsed. I've also worked to include effective use of ids and classes to aid in the future coding of the CSS file.
