        <h1 class="name">Bret J. Zawilski, Ph.D. | Writer, Artist, Scholar</h1> 
        <p class="subtitle"> Welcome to my portfolio. I'm currently serving as a Lecturer of Critical Skills at Maynooth University in Dublin, Ireland. This page is designed to showcase my academic, professional, and personal projects.</p>
        <p>Honestly, this portfolio is a space to pull together my professional and personal interests. The strength of portfoliosis being able to provide a holistic view of an individual, rather than just listing off a series of accomplishments and skills. I'm proud of the work and growth I'm undertaking through each of these pursuits, and ultimately I'm hoping to step more firmly into the creative realm. I write, I think, I argue, and I create. Each of these things are a part of how I see myself nad how I hope to develop over the next years. As with every other human being, growth is continual and I'm not looking to stagnate. Broadly my goal is to inspire critical thinking among the students I work with, but also to speak more broadly to systemic issues in our society through a combination of scholarship, writing, and art. Each of those is a noble endeavor.</p>
        <p>I also don't know what to say or what tone to take in all of this. It's so abstract at times. What do people write on their portfolios? What can I steal?</p>

            <p>I've been fortunate to serve in a number of roles that have allowed me to engage with instructional design and the development of critical and rhetorical digital literacies.

This shift resulted in the creation of significant online resources intended to help students successfully develop an audio podcast building upon previous research they had gathered.</p>

I'm a self-taught artist who's relied upon formal and informal tutorials to learn the basics of composition, color, and form. As I initially write this portfolio content, I see myself as a hobbyist, though I am currently working on several projects of a longer scope and looking to cultivate my own space for visual storytelling.</p>

        	<h2>Print Art</h2>
        	<p>In print, I've experimented most frequently with ink, copic markers, and watercolor. Many of my copic drawings are focused on movies or television shows and I've studied cinematic vision to improve my own understanding of light and form. Frequently my print compositions also connect to my endeavours in Podcasting, with the focus being on movies within the Criterion Collection.</p>
